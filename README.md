# Here's Johnny! 👋
nah, not realy.. My Name is Michael Schlosser and i'm an IT specialist for systems integration from Germany.
I call myself @Schlotter on basicaly every Platform or Game.
Why you ended up here? I can't tell you that!
BUT i can tell you a bit about me; Like i said im from Germany, Bavaria and i work in IT additionally im a paramedic 🚑.
I’m interested in everything related to Computers and Programming is more of a hobby for me.
 📫 If you wish to contact me, you can do that via a Mail to Michael@Schlosser.wtf.
 

### 🌱 I’m permanently trying to learn a bit of everything:

|Language              | My Platform²    |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Bash and Shell       | Windows / Linux |
| C/C++                | mostly Linux    |
| Ruby & Rails         | Windows         |
| Julia                | Windows         |
| React                | Linux           |
| PHP + HTML, CSS, JS  | Linux           |
| Java ☕              | Windows         |
| Python 🐍            | Linux & Windows |

 ² Means the Platform i create it, write the code on, most of it is runing on 🐧 Linux Servers anyway (:

 * I will not really focus on a certain language in the future, but will try to understand a little bit of all languages

* My current Nr.1 IDE is VS Code with the [Vim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)  [[GITHUB](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/)]♥ for everything except Java, i use Eclipse

* btw, have fun using my stuff ^^ maybe it's usefull for you
