- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Schiotter, an IT specialist for systems integration.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything related to Computers. Programming is more of a hobby for me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to learn a bit of everything:
  > Bash and Shell, C & C++, Ruby & Ruby on Rails, PHP + HTML & CSS, React, JS, Java and last but not least Python
  - I will not really focus on a certain language in the future, but will try to understand a little bit of all languages
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via a mail to Michael@Schlosser.wtf
